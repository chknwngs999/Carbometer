        The growing, processing, storing, transporting and disposing of foods all produce some amount of greenhouse gas.
        Food typically produces about 20% of a householdâ€™s total greenhouse gas emissions.
        Different types of food produce differing amounts of greenhouse gases per serving. In this calculator, we have
        chosen some of the most commonly eaten foods to give you an estimate of your food-related carbon footprint.

        <b>Steps to improve your carbon footprint: </b><br>
        <p>
            Eat less meat! A UN report states that livestock farming alone produces 18% of the worldwide greenhouse gas
            emissions. You can also substitute beef and pork, two of the largest CO2 emitting meats, with legumes and
            other plant based proteins. By reducing your meat intake, you are effectively decreasing your contribution
            towards one of the largest greenhouse gas emitting markets.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eat locally grown items. Trucks, ships, and planes transporting the food you eat also emit greenhouse gases.
            Although transporting the food is unavoidable, you can still reduce your emissions by buying locally
            grown items, which would travel fewer miles and have fewer emissions as a result.
