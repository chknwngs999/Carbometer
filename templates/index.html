    <h2>FOOD</h2>
    <p>
      The growing, processing, storing, transporting and disposing of foods all produce some amount of greenhouse gas. Food typically produces about 20% of a household’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Different types of food produce differing amounts of greenhouse gases per serving. In this calculator, we have chosen some of the most commonly eaten foods to give you an estimate of your food-related carbon footprint.

    <h2>CLOTHING</h2>
    <p>
      Huge amounts of water are needed to grow cotton for a piece of clothing, but most of our clothes are made from the polymer, polyester, for which 70 million barrels of oil are used annually to make. On top of making the materials for our clothes, sewing and transporting our clothes also produce greenhouse gases. The emissions from all of these actions combined make it so that the fashion industry to accounts for 10% of global carbon emissions, not to mention 20% of the waste water.

    <h2>UTILITIES</h2>
    <p>
      Transportation is an essential part of our lifestyle, but most vehicles use gasoline or diesel, both of which release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Globally transportation accounts for 15-20% of emissions annually. Emissions from electricity use can vary by the type of fuel source used and by the type of power plant. For instance, coal will release more CO2 than petroleum and natural gas, but nuclear, solar, wind, and hydroelectric don’t release any CO2. The time of day can effect the source of the electricity supplied to the power grid, which means that the carbon footprint of a person also depends on the time of day. In this calculator, we’re using an estimated, average value for the amount of CO2 released by a power plant.
